This is the repository where the StudySphere project will be located.

## 01. Availability
- Not everyone will be able to make every single meeting, so in order to maximize the amount of people in the meetings, multiple meetings per week will be held.
- More effort will at beginning of project for setup
  
## 02. Roles for each week
Meeting roles will be rotated each meeting.
  
## 03. Meeting Scheduling
TODO
  
## 04. Decision Making Process
When a decision needs to be made, it will be put to a majority vote. If a tie occurs, a coin flip will determine the winner.
  
## 05. Team Member Performance
At the beginning of each meeting, everyone will reflect on how the project itself is going along with how their own performance is going. This aims to give everyone the most possible transparency in terms of availability and improvements/adjustments that need to be made.
- If someone misses a meeting, another future meeting should be scheduled
- Try to keep open communications when a meeting cannot be made for one reason or another. This should be done ASAP so everyone can prepare.

Not everyone was able to be physically present in the meeting however we made multiple meetings so everyone could attend.
