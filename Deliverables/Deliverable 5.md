# Deliverable 5 - Group 7

## Instructions
In this deliverable, you should describe the architectural design of your system. Structure your deliverable using the following sections. See the [Team Project Instructions](https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/29116/pages/team-project-%7C-overview) for details about formatting. Check the lecture materials and perform additional research to produce a high-quality deliverable. As usual, if you have any questions, let me know.

## 1. Description
StudySphere allows students to create, manage, and delete their own **student accounts** as needed. The creation of the **student account** deals with attributes such as *email, password, username, Firstname, Lastname, and college* all of which are required prior to account creation. *username* cannot be changed post-registration. Users also have the ability to delete their **student accounts** if they feel the need to do so. The management part of the system relates to the user settings, a subset of account management covered in the following paragraph.

StudySphere offers **group chats** that are moderately customizable in order to enhance the overall user experience and allow for efficient communication between students ( the main purpose of the product ). Each **group chat** allows the **owner** or **administrators** to modify **attributes** such as *group profile picture, group description, group title, members, member count limit, calendar updates, the deletion of the group, the creation of the group, and background color*. These **group chats** provide real time communication between **student accounts** and **groups**, enabling **users** to communicate effectively, plan meetings or study sessions, and most importantly making friends within their community.



## 2. Architecture
Present a diagram of the high-level architecture of your system. Use a UML package diagram to describe the main modules and their interrelation. Please check these [examples](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/package-diagrams-overview.html). Make clear the layers of your architecture (if they exist) as described in [Multi-Layered Application: UML Model Diagram Example](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/multi-layered-application-uml-model-diagram-example.html).

Provide a brief rationale of your architecture explaining why you designed it that way. 

Grading criteria (5 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate design of an architecture for the system; Adequate description of the rationale.



## 3. Class diagram
Present a refined class diagram of your system, including implementation details such as visibilities, attributes to represent associations, attribute types, return types, parameters, etc. The class diagram should match the code you have produced so far but not be limited to it (e.g., it can contain classes not implemented yet). 

The difference between this class diagram and the one you presented in D.3 is that the latter focuses on the domain's conceptual model, while the former reflects the implementation. Therefore, the implementation details are relevant in this case. 

Grading criteria (6 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate choice of classes and relationships; Completeness of the diagram; Adequate presentation of implementation details. 



## 4. Sequence diagram
Present a sequence diagram that represents how the objects in your system interact for a specific use case. Also include the use case's description in this section. The sequence diagram should be consistent with the class diagram and architecture. 

Grading criteria (5 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate design of the sequence diagram; Consistency with the class diagram; Consistency with the use case description; Not including the use case description; Over simplistic diagram.



## 5. Design Patterns
Split this section into two subsections. For each subsection, present a UML class diagram showing the application of a design pattern to your system (a different pattern for each section). Each class diagram should contain only the classes involved in the specific pattern (you donâ€™t need to represent the whole system). Choose patterns from two different categories: Behavioral, Structural, and Creational. You are not limited to design patterns studied in class. 

Tip: Your system may not be appropriate for any design pattern. In this case, for didactic purposes, be creative and extend the scope of your system slightly to make the design patterns appropriate. 

Implement each design pattern in your system and provide GitHub links to the corresponding classes. For example (the links are illustrative, aka fake!):

Car: https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/Car.java

IBreakBehavior: https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/IBreakBehavior.java 

BrakeWithABS: https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/BrakeWithABS.java

Brake: https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/Brake.java

Grading criteria (6 points, 3 for each pattern): Correct use of the design pattern as described in the literature; Adequate choice of the design pattern; Adequate implementation of the design pattern.



## 6. Design Principles
How does your design observe the SOLID principles? Provide a short description of the principles followed and give concrete examples from your classes. 

Grading criteria (6 points): Show correct understanding of SOLID principles; Provide enough details to justify how the principles were observed.
