# Deliverable 5 - Group 7

## Instructions
In this deliverable, you should describe the architectural design of your system. Structure your deliverable using the following sections. See the [Team Project Instructions](https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/29116/pages/team-project-%7C-overview) for details about formatting. Check the lecture materials and perform additional research to produce a high-quality deliverable. As usual, if you have any questions, let me know.

## 1. Description
StudySphere allows students to create and manage their account, as well as create, join, and manage study groups! When a student account is created, we store a lot of information about them such as their name, email, college, and groups that they are a member/owner of. Upon account creation, they are prompted to join a group chat to meet other students to study with!


## 2. Architecture
Present a diagram of the high-level architecture of your system. Use a UML package diagram to describe the main modules and their interrelation. Please check these [examples](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/package-diagrams-overview.html). Make clear the layers of your architecture (if they exist) as described in [Multi-Layered Application: UML Model Diagram Example](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/multi-layered-application-uml-model-diagram-example.html).

Provide a brief rationale of your architecture explaining why you designed it that way. 

Grading criteria (5 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate design of an architecture for the system; Adequate description of the rationale.



## 3. Class diagram
Present a refined class diagram of your system, including implementation details such as visibilities, attributes to represent associations, attribute types, return types, parameters, etc. The class diagram should match the code you have produced so far but not be limited to it (e.g., it can contain classes not implemented yet). 

The difference between this class diagram and the one you presented in D.3 is that the latter focuses on the domain's conceptual model, while the former reflects the implementation. Therefore, the implementation details are relevant in this case. 

Grading criteria (6 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate choice of classes and relationships; Completeness of the diagram; Adequate presentation of implementation details. 



## 4. Sequence diagram
Present a sequence diagram that represents how the objects in your system interact for a specific use case. Also include the use case's description in this section. The sequence diagram should be consistent with the class diagram and architecture. 

Grading criteria (5 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate design of the sequence diagram; Consistency with the class diagram; Consistency with the use case description; Not including the use case description; Over simplistic diagram.



## 5. Design Patterns


The MessageController in our controllers folder implements a simplified Service Layer Pattern by acting as the controller that handles HTTP requests and delegates the business logic to models or services. In this simplified version, the controller is directly responsible for processing incoming requests, handling input validation, interacting with the models, and sending responses. In our pattern there isnâ€™t a separate service layer in this version. The controller directly uses the Model to access the database and handle business logic. Similar patterns can also be found in the other controllers and models.

## 6. Design Principles
How does your design observe the SOLID principles? Provide a short description of the principles followed and give concrete examples from your classes. 

Grading criteria (6 points): Show correct understanding of SOLID principles; Provide enough details to justify how the principles were observed.
