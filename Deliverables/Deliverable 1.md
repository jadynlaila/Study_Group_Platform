# Introduction

Study Sphere is a web platform designed to enhance academic collaboration by connecting students with peers in their field of study through the creation of study groups. Study Sphere fosters a supportive environment where students can share knowledge, apply critical thinking skills, collaborate on coursework and prepare for exams. The platform simplifies the process of forming and managing study groups, making it easier for students to connect virtually or in-person, ultimately improving academic performance and fostering a strong sense of community.

# Initial Value Proposition & Customer Segments

*Report the initial guesses for the (i) value proposition and (ii) customer segment. The value proposition is different from the feature(s) your software will offer. See examples on the lecture slides.*

Value Proposition: Improving academic success, collaboration skills, and improving social skills and ability to meet new people.   
Preparing students for academic success by providing skills .

Customer Segments: Students need a platform to meet and study, a designated platform to find other students with the same majors and classes, to find help or study before exams. Creating a group and joining a group with the ability to chat and schedule times to meet is a good solution. 

# Interviews Summary

*Present the results of each interview (the minimum number of interviews is 1.5 \* the number of participants in the group).* 

*Number each interview and report for each one of them:*

1)   
* *Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview*  
  * Riya Soni \- International student, 1st year graduate student in computer science.  
* *When*  
  * 09/20/2024 \- Over a video call  
* *Customer segment represented in the interview*  
* *Key insights from the interview*  
  * Students will use this app but not as much as other platforms and social media apps.  
  * People are also hesitant to join groups with people they don’t know  
* *Representative quotes*  
  * “ I like the idea but it’s similar to other platforms like discord, and LinkedIn where it’s easy to find people in the same field as you. Try and find a feature that will make your website different from others”  
* *Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how strongly the interviewee needs the proposed solution)*  
  * **Must have:** A feature that suggests other people in the same courses but with similar interests.  
    * This solves the problem of joining groups with unknown people as well as being in a study group with people you don’t really like.  
  * **Nice to have:** A google classroom/canvas feature where you can import your course calendars into the website.  
  * **Don’t care:** Making the app different than other apps like discord and LinkedIn  
    * This is a don’t care because our app is already different but with the must have feature it will definitely make the app different.

  * *The ability to see one's schedule/availability would be considered a useful feature.*  
  * *Retaking a class is an easy way to lose an entire study group you may have discovered in person, and thus increases the need for such a product.*  
  * *Ability to mark people as friends would be nice as the social aspect of a study group platform BEYOND school would be appreaciated*  
* *Representative quotes*  
  * *“Not knowing many people and having to retake classes and losing the people I grew comfortable with for study sessions is the main reason why something like this would be handy.”*  
* *Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how strongly the interviewee needs the proposed solution)*

* *Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview*  
  * *Aisjah Mabunay (2nd year Nursing student)*  
  * *Interviewer: Jadyn Calhoun*  
* *When*  
  * *9/18/24*  
* *Customer segment represented in the interview*  
  * *College Student*  
  * *Studies Alone*   
* *Key insights from the interview*  
  * *As this is her first semester taking nursing classes, Aisjah has found that her studies are ramping up and the workload has increased rapidly. Before she could get away with not studying with others, but now she’s been more interested in the idea of having somebody to bounce ideas off of. In the past, her main barrier against finding a study group has been shyness- she doesn’t go out of her way to talk to people in her classes, so meeting people who she would want to study with hasn’t happened naturally. She is interested in StudySphere as it could remove that wall for her in an easily approachable way.*   
* *Representative quotes*  
  * *“It’s way less intimidating talking to and asking questions to my peers than my professors”*  
* *Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how strongly the interviewee needs the proposed solution)*  
  * *Must have: Scheduling help and the ability to see the availability of group members*  
  * *Nice to have: It would be cool if it could eventually turn into something where you worked with schools, and you could be automatically added to the group chats of classes you’re taking.*  
  * *Don’t care: I wouldn’t ever really video call people*

* *Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview*  
  * *Taylor Daine (3rd year Social Work student)*  
  * *Interviewer: Jadyn Calhoun*  
* *When*  
  * *9/18/24*  
* *Customer segment represented in the interview*  
  * *College Student*  
  * *Studies Alone*   
* *Key insights from the interview*  
  * *In the field of social work, there is not much collaboration between students. Many assignments are essays and paper, where ideas are individual and opinion based. Taylor mostly finds no need to be in a study group, despite being a full time student. However, the longer we talked about our idea, she found another use in it. Despite the fact that she doesn’t need someone else to study with- simply having other social work students to talk with could be a great way to debrief\! The contents of these classes can be immensely draining on mental health, and having another person who can relate can hopefully provide some relief*  
* *Representative quotes*  
  * *“ I have a 2 1⁄2 hour lecture that is just about death and people dying. I read chapters every day from a book where a man describes in great detail the major losses he’s had in his life. It’s so depressing”*  
* *Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how strongly the interviewee needs the proposed solution)*  
  * *Must have: Fast communication. If we’re having conversations over the messaging system I don’t want it to be slow. Gotta be imessage fast.*   
  * *Nice to have: It would be cool if you could add some customization to the chat stuff. Like unique backgrounds or pictures and stuff. Just ways to make it individual and more interesting*  
  * *Don’t care: The scheduling help wouldn’t really be for me personally, I don’t need to meet with people as much as it would be for just talking and stuff.*

* *Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview*  
  * *Dylan Bradley (3rd year Psychology Student)*  
  * *Interviewer: Alexander Anthis*  
* *When*  
  * *9/18/24*  
* *Customer segment represented in the interview*  
  * *College Student*  
  * *Sometimes studies alone, sometimes with brother or with friends*  
* *Key insights from the interview*  
  * *It’s difficult to work through scheduling issues when planning a study session with someone else, whether online or in person.*  
  * *When finding people to study with, it’d be nice to filter by class section.*  
  * *Finding people who are also looking for other people could filter out group/study members who aren’t as “enthusiastic” about the class as the rest of the group*  
  * *It’d be nice if study groups could be further grouped by classrooms which could be managed by professors*  
* *Representative quotes*  
  * *“From what this sounds like, this platform would be great for initial contact with group members.”*  
* *Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how strongly the interviewee needs the proposed solution)*  
  * *Nice to have (not that critical, but would enhance workflows)*  
  * *Would be good for initial group contact to then transfer over to another messaging platform*

  * *College Student*  
  * *Practices rather than studies due to nature of major*  
  * *Presentations take place of exams*  
  * *Practices with classmates*  
* *Key insights from the interview*  
  * *In Theatre, “studying” takes form in terms of getting acting practice in, which greatly changes how “studying” takes place.*  
  * *Groups are usually preassigned and can be either big or small, depending on the presentation type.*  
  * *Current communication is through group texts, which isn’t convenient.*  
  * *Biggest pain with groups is determining availability, which especially isn’t easy over a group text.*  
* *Representative quotes*  
  * *“Currently, I reach out through Canvas to my assigned group members.”*  
  * *“Right now, our professor assigns us times for us to meet and practice.”*  
* *Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how strongly the interviewee needs the proposed solution)*

  * *Uses a platform at his school called “halo”*  
* *Representative quotes*  
  * *“Personally I wouldn't use an application that often. I have a group of friends taking the same degree program and we mainly study together. I do see the benefit for a larger school in which there can be many students who don't have friends all in the same degree program. I feel that this type of application can benefit many students.”*  
  * *“I do feel that studying in a group can be effective at bringing together minds to solve problems and solve them more efficiently. Studying alone can make you more distracted through things like your phone and roommates to annoy you. If you have a good study who is focused on the task at hand than I find a great benefit to that.*

# Final Value Proposition and Customer Segments

*Report the refined versions of these elements (the ones you refined based on the interviews). The customer segment(s) should be narrow, and there must be enough representation of the segment(s) in the interviews.* 

Value Proposition: Study Sphere simplifies the process of connecting students with study groups, making it easy to discover, join, and schedule collaborative meetups that boost academic success.

Customer Segment: Study Sphere aims to assist students from any sized university that require a way to find or connect with groups. It primarily targets students who study for exams, but can also target groups that require availability scheduling.
