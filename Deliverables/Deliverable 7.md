# Deliverable 7
## 1. Description

StudySphere is a web-based platform designed to foster academic success and build a sense of community among college students by facilitating the creation and management of study groups. The idea behind this project is to create a tool for students by students. There exists an unspoken challenge that university students face, which is the difficulty in connecting with peers for study collaboration. Our purpose of this projcect is to promote community and boost academic success. 

Our app is powered by technologies such as React, Express.js, MongoDB, and Node.js. For testing purposes we used JWT (JSON Web Token) and Axios. We approached this project by defining a minimum viable product that consists of a user friendly UI, that follows a simple structure with a minimal page implementation. What makes our app special is the filter by university as it allows you to connect with people in your university that take the same classes as you. Our web app consists of the following components:
- Log In / Sign Up 
- Group search
- Join Group
- Create a group
- Create Meeting
- Messaging
- Settings

Suggestions:

* Add colors for group to ‘color coordinate’

* Advance the chat to have more functionality, Images, @ mention. 
* List school in the group information in the join section
* Member count limits when scaling up. If a user is inactive for a long period of time, the user is kicked from the group for inactivity to free space. 
* Limit some groups to school, but also have larger groups.

### Reflections: 
* seemed easy to navigate for the user
* user performed tasks correctly based off instruction
* User likes the design / color, but it is barebones.
* User like the ability to find new people, thinks private groups would remove the point of 'finding' a group. 
* needs more functionality, but user likes the simplicity of the current UI.
* expand user roles
* value proposition is met,however it needs to be deployed and polished so it can be used widely
