### Reflections: 
* seemed easy to navigate for the user
* user performed tasks correctly based off instruction
* User likes the design / color, but it is barebones.
* User like the ability to find new people, thinks private groups would remove the point of 'finding' a group. 
* needs more functionality, but user likes the simplicity of the current UI.
* expand user roles
* value proposition is met,however it needs to be deployed and polished so it can be used widely
