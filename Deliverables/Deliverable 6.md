# Deliverable 6 - Group 7

## Instructions
This deliverable should describe the second release of your project. A release is a fully functional software that delivers a set of features (it doesn’t need to be the complete set, but the software needs to be usable). Structure your deliverable into the following sections. See the “Team Project Instructions” for details about formatting.

## 1. Introduction
Provide 1-2 paragraphs to describe your system. This description should contain the value proposition and the main features. At the end of the introduction, include a link to your project on GitHub.

Grading criteria (1 point): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language. The description should be consistent with the current state of the project. You should include the link to GitHub.

(The group settings do not properly allocate the groupID from the specific groups. However they would have similar styling and function to the user settings.)



## 3. Tests

### 3.1 Unit tests

A unit test is an automated test that aims to verify the behavior of a component isolated from the rest of the system. For this deliverable, show an example of a unit test that uses mock objects to isolate the class from the rest of the system. 

Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.)
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located
An example of a test case that makes use of mock objects. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test
A print screen showing the result of the unit test execution
Grading criteria (2 points): adequate choice of a test framework, coverage of the tests, quality of the tests, adequate use of Mock objects, and a print screen showing successful test execution.

### 3.2 Acceptance tests

An acceptance test is a test that verifies the correct implementation of a feature from the user interface perspective. An acceptance test is a black box test (the system is tested without knowledge about its internal implementation). Provide the following information:

Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., Selenium, Katalon Studio, Espresso2, Cucumber, etc.)
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated acceptance tests are located
An example of an acceptance test. Include a GitHub link to the test and an explanation about the tested feature in your answer.
A print screen/video showing the acceptance test execution
Grading criteria (2 points): adequate choice of a test framework, coverage of the tests, quality of the tests, adequate example of an acceptance test, print screen/video showing successful test execution.

## 4. Demo
Include a link to a video showing the system working.

Grading criteria (10 points): This section will be graded based on the quality of the video and on the evidence that the features are running as expected. Additional criteria are the relevance of the demonstrated functionalities, the correctness of the functionalities, and the quality of the developed system from the external point of view (user interface).
