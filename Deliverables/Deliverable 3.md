# System Description
*Provide a brief textual description of your system. The first paragraph of the description must contain the problem statement, the product position statement, and the value proposition of your system (you can refine/update what you presented in D.2). The following paragraphs should describe the key requirements of the system. This description should be consistent with D.2 stakeholders, requirements, use cases, and user stories. Again, refinements/updates are welcome since your understanding of the system is constantly evolving.*

*Use Bold every time you use a noun that is a class in your model. Use Italic every time you use a noun that is an attribute in your model. Use Bold and Italic every time you use a noun or verb that is an association in your model.* 

*Grading criteria (5 points): The description should be clear, concise, and well-written, free of typos and grammar problems. The use of bold, italic, and underline should be coherent with the model presented in Section 2---all classes, attributes, and associations from the model should appear in the text consistently with the model.*

studysphere offers **group chats** that are moderately customizable in order to enhance the overall user experience and allow for efficient communication between students ( the main purpose of the product ). Each **group chat** allows the **owner** or **administrators** to modify **attributes** such as *group profile picture, group description, group title, members, member count limit, calendar updates, the deletion of the group, the creation of the group, and background color*. These groupchats provide real time communication between **student accounts** and **groups**, enabling users to communicate effectively, plan meetings or study sessions, and most importantly making friends within their community



# Model
*Provide the conceptual model of your system as a UML class diagram. Represent proper cardinalities (multiplicities) for all associations. Also include the association names.* 

*Some points to consider:*

- *Use UML adequately. Do not use graphical elements that are not part of the language. Represent compositions and aggregations when relevant.*
- *This model is not an ER diagram (entity-relationship model), which is focused on relational database systems. However, both diagrams have similarities.* 
- *Do not overcomplicate how you represent the elements of your model (e.g., using inheritance or an association when they are not necessary). Pay attention to simplicity, maintainability, unnecessary repetition, cohesion, and coupling.*
- *Do not represent actions that donâ€™t need to be registered in the system.* 
- *Do not represent technical elements, such as user interface or programming language libraries in the model. At this point, we are modeling the business logic/domain of your system. The model will be refined during the design phase to include technology-specific elements and decisions.* 
- *Do not represent "System" as a class in your model. Everything that you are modeling is part of the system.*
- *If you need to justify your decisions, you can write your rationale in this section or use UML comments in the diagram.*
- *The model must have at least 8 classes. If you need more classes, you can add requirements in the system description that did not appear in D2.*

*Grading criteria: You should correctly use the UML specification. Your model should have the minimum number of classes. Your domain should be adequately modeled. The model should avoid unnecessary complexity, repetition, lack of cohesion, and coupling. The classes should be at an adequate abstraction level.*
